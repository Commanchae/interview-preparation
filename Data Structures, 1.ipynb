    "### Arrays\n",
    "So Python doesn't have in-built support for arrays as it has lists instead. In the traditional sense of arrays, they are a collection of *same data-type* variables stored *contiguously* in the memory. They have a fixed size which you define at declaration **(the amount of memory located depends on the datatype)**. They are static in size and CANNOT be changed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "- Arrays are used in the implementation of lot of algorithms and other data structures.\n",
    "- Allows O(1) accessing operation.\n",
    "- Memory efficient as size of array is known at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "- Fixed size makes it not ideal for problems requiring dynamic resizing of the array."
